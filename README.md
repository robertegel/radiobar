## RadioBar

macOS menubar app to play user-defined radio stations with help from [rumps](https://github.com/jaredks/rumps) and VLC. It includes a `remote` to switch channels, on/off, pause/resume etc. Forked from [radiobar](https://github.com/mdbraber/radiobar) by [Maarten den Braber](https://github.com/mdbraber), just added some stations that I find interesting.

## Installation

`python setup.py py2app`
